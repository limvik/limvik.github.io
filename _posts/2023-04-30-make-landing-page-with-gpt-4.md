## Intro

이전에 콘솔(Console) 프로그램을 만들면서 머릿속에 있는 애매한 요구사항 때문에 괴로웠던 기억이 있어서, 요구사항을 잘 정리해볼 겸 이리저리 찾아봤습니다. 아주 간단하게 샘플과 함께 요구사항 명세서를 설명해주신 분의 글([링크](https://mklab-co.medium.com/%EC%9E%91%EC%84%B1%EB%B2%95-%EC%9A%94%EA%B5%AC%EC%82%AC%ED%95%AD-%EB%AA%85%EC%84%B8%EC%84%9C-requirements-specification-ad3533d6d5b8))이 있어서 이렇게 작성하면 되겠구나 했습니다.

그런데 이번에는 잘 만들어보려하니, 사용자가 처음 만나야하는 화면은 무엇인지부터 시작해서 스스로가 만들고 싶은게 뭔지 구체화하기가 생각보다 어려웠습니다.

그래서 답답한 마음에 chat GPT로 요구사항도 만들어보고, 랜딩 페이지 구성을 HTML과 CSS로 간단하게 출력해봤습니다.

## 요구사항

공개된 Prompt를 찾다가 [beebom](https://beebom.com/best-chatgpt-prompts/) 이라는 사이트에서 아래 Prompt를 찾았습니다. 굵은 색으로 표시된 부분만 제 어플리케이션에 맞춰 수정된 상태입니다.

> I want you to act as a web design consultant. I will provide you with details related to an organization needing assistance designing or redeveloping its website, and your role is to suggest the most suitable interface and features that can enhance user experience while also meeting the company’s business goals. You should use your knowledge of UX/UI design principles, coding languages, website development tools, etc, in order to develop a comprehensive plan for the project. My first request is “I need help creating an **flashcards site for efficiently learn and memorize**.”

나름 나쁘지 않게 답을 주기는 하는데, 추상적인 느낌이라 좀 더 구체적으로 요청을 적는게 좋은 답을 얻을 수 있을 것 같습니다.

제가 생각하는 요구사항을 모두 반영하고 있지는 않지만, 여기에 추가해 나가면 되니까 꽤나 만족스럽습니다.

그리고 간단하게 Home/Landing Screen을 출력시켜 봤습니다.

## HTML/CSS 를 이용한 페이지 생성

> Generate HTML document with CSS for a Home/Landing Screen

Here's a basic HTML document with embedded CSS for a Home/Landing Screen:

This code provides a simple HTML structure and CSS styling for a Home/Landing Screen. You can modify and expand upon this template to better suit your specific design and functionality requirements. Additionally, consider using a responsive design framework like Bootstrap or Foundation to create a mobile-friendly layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

To further enhance the look and feel of your Home/Landing Screen, you can also incorporate custom fonts, colors, and other design elements that align with your branding. Finally, don't forget to test your page across various devices and browsers to ensure optimal performance and compatibility for all users.

너무 기대를 안한건지도 모르겠지만, 제 기대보다는 만족스러운 결과였습니다. 더 괜찮은 Prompt 를 사용하거나 제시된 HTML 문서에서 어떤 look and feel로 수정해달라고 요청하면 더 만족스러운 결과를 얻을 수 있을 것 같습니다. 저는 제가 원하는 걸 구체화 하는게 먼저인 것 같아서 여기서 중단했습니다.

## Outro

좋은 Prompt와 질문의 순서를 잘 조절하면 어플리케이션 만드는데 제가 부족한 부분을 많이 채워줄 수 있을 것 같습니다. 그전에 저는 다른 어플리케이션도 둘러보면서 아이디어 구체화부터 해야겠습니다.
